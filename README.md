# graphing_calculator
Graphing Calculator is an application designed to help users analyze mathematical function. 


The application gives information, such as minimum and maximum values of a function on a certain interval, asymptotes and an visual represenation of the function's graph. User can interact with application in two ways: by typing mathematical functions directly into the console and by using the graphic interface for accessing additional tools.

During the representation of a function, we can move the screen wherever we want to view the function over different intervals or to zoom in and out for a closer or wider view.
